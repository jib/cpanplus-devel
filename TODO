### cpanplus 0.050_01 release requirements ###
* use extutils::autoinstall to fetch chosen prereqs in makefile.pl
    EU::AI doesn't support cpanplus' own new api yet, so it's not
    feasible to have EU::AI install prereqs. bundle them for now.
    * compat API added to CPANPLUS, but we still have a bootstrap issue
      without some of these prereqs, so keep bundling anyway


### todo code marks things that are present in 0.04x but not in 0.05x yet
### wishlist is new features we want to add

### TODO ###

### installing ###
* Support autobundle installation
    low priority for now

### testing ###
* Perhaps add a check where one can't send out a certain report
    more than once?
    * depends on how long it takes for testers.cpan.org to pick
        it up
* Improve test coverage
* offer module authors a way to include debugging output from 'make test'
    with the automated reporting system
    * POE and Test::Reporter both create extra debugging information on disk
* skip t/20's install tests if PERL_CORE is set, to facilitate perl core
    inclusion (mostly to compensate for the guesswork during makefile.pl)

### UI ###
* For the default shell, let 'h' show a help list, and '?' more details on
  a specific command
    - the syntax is supported now, but the help isn't written yet.
* Conditional pager opens?
* let 'o' take regexes. current workaround: m re*; o *;


### dists ###
* Dist::RPM, ::PPM, ::Ports, etc
* We just split out 'create' into prepare & create
    * stresstest (another beta release?)


### WISHLIST ###
* Version check on startup
* Self update
    - Acme::SoftwareUpdate?
* Check if a module already exists in the package manager of choice?
* Periodic host checking (see if they're still good mirrors)
* Make error stack reports available on a per-module (dist) basis,
    as discussed in '[Cpanplus-devel] error stack reporting a bit overzealous'
* Test reports should only contain texts of the module they pertain to,
    rather than all modules in the current loop (like i 1..10 from the shell)
    also reported as ticket [#11404]


### ISSUES ###
* Figure out what the best way is to check 'uptodateness' for modules,
    especially because M::B version ranges are different from EU::MM
    - perhaps use version.pm?
        * yes, ping jpeacock
    - use M::B?
    - use M::L::Conditional?
